# zkSNARK Workshop

This workshop will guide you through building your first zkSNARK circuit, which will help you learn the basics of this technology. We will create a game called ZK Sudoku, where we will send a proof of solving the puzzle to a smart contract, and in return, we will receive an NFT as a reward.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have Node.js installed. It is recommended to install it via NVM on Linux. You will also need a wallet compatible with the Goerli network, such as MetaMask, with some funds obtained from a faucet.
